Devs may choose to take DTI for one (1) credit if the College of Engineering
denies their petition to credit overload. Since DTI counts for fewer credits,
your DTI responsibilities are adjusted accordingly. In particular, we're taking
out some of the team requirements and focusing your 1 credit work on your
subteam, so you can make the most impact.

## Team Requirements

- Attendance at 2 All Hands
- 1 team event credit
- Team Assignment not required

## Dev Requirements

- 3 (out of 5) dev portfolios
- Dev Assignment 2
- DevSesh is completely optional
