## Description

A learning doc is simply a document detailing a technology or stack which you
have learned in place of your team work for the current assignment. In this
document, you should break down exactly what you learned and from where you
learned it. Be sure to link any tutorials or examples that you referenced or
followed. In the end, it would likely be easiest to have an example repo
containing a demo that showcases all the new things you've learned.

## Basic Requirements

- Design decisions (behavior for uncommon cases, which scenarios to support, etc)
- Implementation plans (implement infra A, then function B, then UI C)
- Potential risks and difficulties, if any

# Grading Tiers
