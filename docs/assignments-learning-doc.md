## Description

A learning doc is simply a document detailing a technology or stack which you
have learned in place of your team work for the current assignment. In this
document, you should break down exactly what you learned and from where you
learned it. Be sure to link any tutorials or examples that you referenced or
followed. In the end, it would likely be easiest to have an example repo
containing a demo that showcases all the new things you've learned.

## Basic Requirements

- For **devs** who want/need to learn to learn something new.
- Need to talk to TPM first to come up with actionable learning plan
- Required sections
  - A link to your **personal** GitHub repo to demonstrate that you actually learned the stuff.
  - Technology Overview
    - Your own summary of the purpose of the technology
    - What problems does it solve? Pros and cons
  - Concept explanation
    - Use your personal repo as as example, illustrate how is this technology applied (how to use the framework, workflow)
  - Application
    - How do you plan to use this technology in your subteam&#39;s codebase later
  - (Note: if you are new/recently transitioned to a new role or subteam, doing the learning progress document on learning a portion of your team&#39;s current tech stack, ie learning Firebase or Typescript or Vue, is encouraged and explaining that is a valid reason for these questions).

## Grading Tiers

93%: Contribution was below expectations for that member of the team.

- No examples of actually attempting to code tutorials or own work set by themselves and TPM provided (ie no technical proof of learning)

96%: Contribution was at expectations for that member of the team. This is the baseline grade.

- Pros and cons of your approach are described.
- Plan is mostly actionable.

100%: Contribution was above expectations for that member of the team.

- Pros and cons of your approach are clearly described.
- Strong justification of why your design is optimal or most feasible.
