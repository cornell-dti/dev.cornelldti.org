## Description

Outline tasks for this semester and, if possible, who will be assigned to them.
Your plans should be feasible, detailed, clear, and a good quantitative indicator of your team's progress.

Please include the following:

- A list of features and fixes you plan to implement triaged by importance and difficulty
- Any new technologies that you or your devs will introduce your project
- Dev changes: dev shortages? Do you have someone who wants to quit or make an internal transfer?
