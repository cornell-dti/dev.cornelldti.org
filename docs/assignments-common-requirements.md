## Assignment Options

You will choose one of the below assignment options:

- [Learning Goals + Learning Progress](/docs/assignments-learning-doc) (**Newbie assignment only**)
- [Pull Request Discussion](/docs/assignments-pull-request-discussion)
- [Unit Testing](/docs/assignments-unit-testing)
- [Documentation of Existing Code](/docs/assignments-documentation)
- [Semester Plan](/docs/assignments-semester-plan) (**TPM first assignment only**, if you're a developer with a good reason for doing this, contact `@dev-leadz` )
- [Semester Reflection](/docs/assignments-semester-reflection) (** End of Semester assignment for full-credit developers and TPMs only **)
- [Design Doc](/docs/assignments-design-doc)
- [Technical Critique/Security Vulnerability](/docs/assignments-tech-critique-security-doc)

_Have an idea for a different dev assignment option?_ Get permission from `@dev-leadz` and work with your TPM to ensure your idea is feasible and fits in our assignment requirements. Some example other dev assignment options we've accepted are: **dev onboarding document**, **TPM onboarding document**, and **SEV postmortem** (but do still let us know if you're considering these options!)

:::note
Each option can only be used once per a semester. Contact `@dev-leadz` with a good reason why you want to repeat an option. Pull request discussion can only be used once; no exceptions.

## Format

Each dev assignment should be a writeup with the following baseline requirements:

- At least 2-3 paragraphs, 300-450 words
- Must be in a legible font, double-spacing recommended, PDF format
- Must be based on work done this semester that has not been presented in an assignment before

## Late Policy

All dev assignments should be submitted by the deadline. Late submissions will be demoted to the next lowest grade tier (e.g. 96 to 93 or 93 to 90). In exchange, `@dev-leadz` promise to finish grading each dev assignment before the next one is due.
