title: 'Technical Critique / Security Vulnerability'
---

## Warning (Read Carefully!)

This type of written assignment will be forwarded to relevant subteams&#39; channels with your personal information anonymized, if you agree to share. **DO NOT** create a GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities (because we don&#39;t want to publicize how to take down DTI projects)! You are **NOT** allowed to hack non-DTI users&#39; accounts on the production site. Avoid hacking DTI users&#39; accounts to demonstrate the problem if you can.

## Description

- Technical critique required sections:
  - Problem
    - Potential list: bad architecture, bad coding practices, bad design, etc
  - Solution
    - This should be the focus; remember, the goal is to **improve** the quality of DTI apps, not tear them apart.
  - Reflection (if applicable, required for TPM)
    - Is there similar problems in the codebase of your subteam? If so, what do you plan to fix that.
    - What does other subteam&#39;s codebase inspire you? Is it possible to do similar stuff in your codebase?
- Security vulnerability review required sections:
  - How to exploit
  - How to fix
  - How to prevent this in the future
  - How does this incident prompt your subteam to design more secure systems (if applicable)

## Grading Tiers

93%: Contribution was below expectations for that member of the team.

- Issue or vulnerability is clearly not an actual issue
- Vulnerability/issue is created for the sake of being able to write about it

96%: Contribution was at expectations for that member of the team. This is the baseline grade.

- Issue or vulnerability is problematic to that product
- Provide an decent attack plan

100%: Contribution was above expectations for that member of the team.

- Issue or vulnerability is not obvious to find and is problematic to that product
- Provide an actionable attack plan
- Real Examples:
