title: 'PM vs. TPM Guide for Team Members'
---

While the distinction between PM and TPM may be clear to the managers, it may not be as clear to the team members. This is a practical guide for the team members so they can know who to reach out to if they have questions.

**Go to TPM if…**

- You have a bug you cannot fix
- You are a developer and unsure of what you are doing this week
- You are a designer and you want to make a point about the implementation of your design on the website
- You find a package that you think would be really cool to add to Research Connect
- You have a pull request that has not been completed after a week
- You are implementing a feature and are unsure how to implement something
- You are a developer and your task seems too difficult
- You are a developer and you have time for more tasks

**Go to PM if...**

- You are a designer and you are unsure of what you are doing this week
- You are a designer and you have an idea for a new addition to the website
- You have an idea for marketing or feature
- You have a question about the user research for a task/feature
- You have a question regarding or are concerned about the direction or future of the product
- You have a question about a meeting time/place
- You have someone who you think would be a good person to talk to about the product
- You have any questions about the team's roadmap/timeline

**Either**

- You are doing a 1:1
- You are having an issue with how either PM/TPM is handling the team
  - Reach out to the team leads if it’s serious.
- You’re implementing a feature and are unsure about how a feature would function or look like
- You have something that doesn’t fit in this list
