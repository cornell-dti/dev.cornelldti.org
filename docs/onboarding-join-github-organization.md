## Step 1: create a GitHub account

If you don't have a GitHub account, you should visit [GitHub sign-up page](https://github.com/join)
to create a new account.

Note that Cornell's enterprise GitHub is not connected to github.com, so you still need to have
an account on github.com.

## Step 2: Setup 2-factor authentication

[`cornell-dti`](https://github.com/cornell-dti) GitHub organization enforces the policy that every
member must have 2-factor authentication properly setup.

You should read and follow the instructions
[here](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa).

## Step 3: Asking a developer lead to add you to `cornell-dti`

Ask the developer lead on slack.
