title: 'Unit Testing'

## Description

We encourage all teams to do extensive testing on their codebase to ensure all code is correct and robust. In your assignment, *please detail your testing plan and coverage* and *how you refactored the existing code so that things are testable*. Also, if possible please try to integrate testing checks into your CI workflow. 

:::note
Your set of unit tests can only be used for one assignment. (i.e., you cannot use this for both the PR and unit test assignments)
