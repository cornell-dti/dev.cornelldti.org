# Dev-TPM 1:1s

TPMs should hold 1:1s with their devs throughout the semester.

## Suggested Topics

- Do you still want to be a developer on this subteam?
- Do you want to transfer?
- Do you want to switch roles? (to Business? Design? iOS Developer?)
- What is your intended commitment level for this/next sem (normal, reduced credit)?
- What are you interested in doing (learning? coding?) this semester?
- What do you want to work on within the subteam? Frontend vs Backend?
- Feedback for the past/current semester
